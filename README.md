# Profile Readme Generator: Craft Your Perfect GitHub Profile README

## Description

Your GitHub profile README is your digital storefront, showcasing your skills, projects, and personality to the developer community. Creating an engaging and informative profile README can be challenging and time-consuming. The **Profile Readme Generator** project simplifies this process by providing a specialized command-line tool designed to automatically generate stunning and personalized GitHub profile `README.md` files. Using interactive prompts and customizable templates, it helps you incorporate dynamic elements like GitHub stats, skill badges, social media links, and more, ensuring your profile stands out. Save time, impress visitors, and effectively communicate your developer identity with a professionally generated profile README.

## Key Features

*   **Profile-Focused Templates:** Offers templates specifically designed for GitHub profile READMEs, incorporating common and popular sections.
*   **Interactive CLI:** Guides you through adding essential profile information: name, bio, location, social links (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.), portfolio/website URL.
*   **Dynamic Content Integration:** Facilitates easy inclusion of popular dynamic elements:
    *   GitHub Stats Cards (e.g., via `github-readme-stats` by anuraghazra)
    *   Top Languages Card
    *   WakaTime Stats (if applicable)
    *   Visitor Badges/Counters
    *   Skill & Technology Badges (e.g., via Shields.io)
    *   Latest Blog Posts (requires integration/RSS feed)
    *   GitHub Activity Feed (requires integration)
*   **Section Customization:** Allows adding, removing, or reordering sections like:
    *   Introduction / About Me
    *   Skills / Technologies
    *   Current Projects / Pinned Repositories
    *   GitHub Stats
    *   Social Links / Connect With Me
    *   Support / Sponsorship Links (GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee)
*   **Theme & Style Options:** Provides options to customize the appearance of elements like stats cards (themes, colors).
*   **Markdown Best Practices:** Generates clean, well-formatted Markdown suitable for GitHub profile display.
*   **Extensibility:** Potential to add support for more third-party profile widgets or data sources.
*   **Configuration File Support:** Pre-fill common details (like GitHub username, preferred theme) using a configuration file (e.g., `.profile-readme-genrc`).

## Installation

Install the Profile Readme Generator using your preferred package manager or by cloning the repository.

**Cloning the Repository:**

```bash
# Clone from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/NhanPhamThanh-IT/Profile-Readme-Generator.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd Profile-Readme-Generator

# Install dependencies (adjust based on project's package manager)
npm install

# Build steps (if applicable)
# e.g., npm run build

# Link for global access (optional, example for npm)
# npm link
```

## Usage

Generating your profile README is simple. Run the command, and it will guide you through the process.

**Basic Interactive Mode:**

The easiest way is to run the command directly. It will ask for your details interactively.

```bash
Profile-Readme-Generator
```

**Specifying Output File:**

By default, it might create `PROFILE_README.md` or similar. You can specify the output name (GitHub requires it to be `README.md` in a repository named after your username).

```bash
Profile-Readme-Generator --output README.md
```

**Providing GitHub Username (Crucial for Stats/Links):**

You'll likely need to provide your GitHub username for many features.

```bash
Profile-Readme-Generator --username YourGitHubUsername --output README.md
```

**Using Flags for Non-Interactive Generation:**

Provide details directly via flags (flags depend on implementation):

```bash
Profile-Readme-Generator --username YourGitHubUsername --name "Your Name" --bio "Your awesome bio" --linkedin your-linkedin --twitter YourTwitter --theme dark --output README.md --yes
```
*(The `--yes` flag might skip confirmations)*

**Output Location:**

Remember to save the generated `README.md` file inside a **public repository** on GitHub that has the **same name as your GitHub username**.

Refer to `Profile-Readme-Generator --help` for all available options.

## Configuration

Configure the generator for repeated use or to set personal defaults.

*   **Configuration File:** A file like `.profile-readme-genrc` or `config.json` in your home directory or project root can store defaults.

    *Example (`.profile-readme-genrc` in JSON):*
    ```json
    {
      "githubUsername": "YourGitHubUsername",
      "name": "Your Full Name",
      "socials": {
        "linkedin": "your-linkedin-profile",
        "twitter": "YourTwitterHandle",
        "website": "https://yourwebsite.com"
      },
      "statsCard": {
        "theme": "radical",
        "show_icons": true
      },
      "skills": ["JavaScript", "Python", "React", "Node.js", "Docker"],
      "skipPrompts": ["supportLinks"]
    }
    ```

*   **Environment Variables:** Some settings might be configurable via environment variables.
    *   `PROFILE_README_GEN_USERNAME="YourGitHubUsername"`
    *   `PROFILE_README_GEN_THEME="dark"`

*   **Key Options (Examples):**
    *   `githubUsername`: (String) Your GitHub username (essential).
    *   `name`, `bio`, `location`: (String) Personal details.
    *   `socials`: (Object) Key-value pairs for social media handles/URLs.
    *   `statsCard`: (Object) Options for the GitHub stats card (theme, visibility, etc.).
    *   `skills`: (Array of Strings) List of skills/technologies for badges.
    *   `theme`: (String) Default theme for applicable widgets.
